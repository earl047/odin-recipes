    <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
    <p>For many Filipinos, learning how to cook chicken adobo counts as a life milestone. Warm, familiar, and ever-present on our tables, its an institution among comfort foods—the very meal our mothers made for us growing up. With each delicious bite, you cant help but feel at ease.</p>
    <p>However, if you are a stickler for your health, you may have come to the sad conclusion that chicken adobo is quite the indulgence. Because of its salty, meat-centric nature, its the kind of dish a health nut will only get to have occasionally.</p>
    <p>Here some good news: while it certainly a far cry from a bowlful of salad, chicken adobo can be prepared in a way that increases its nutritional value. All you need to do is add a hearty leafy green to the mix. And voilà! Your adobo gets a wholesome veggie touch.
